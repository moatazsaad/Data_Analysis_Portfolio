This project involves several key steps in data analysis and backtesting investment strategies using US stocks:

    Web Scraping Dow Jones Constituents: Scraping the Dow Jones Industrial Average (DJI) constituents from Wikipedia to gather the list of stocks included in the index.

    Loading and Saving Historical Stock Prices: Utilizing Yahoo Finance API (yfinance) to download historical stock prices for both the DJI index and its constituents. Data is then saved into CSV files for further analysis.

    Backtesting Investment Strategies:
        Buy and Hold Strategy: Simply holding onto the DJI index.
        Simple Momentum Strategy: Buying DJI tomorrow if today's return was positive and short selling DJI tomorrow if today's return was negative.
        Simple Contrarian Strategy: Short selling DJI tomorrow if today's return was positive and buying DJI tomorrow if today's return was negative.
        More Complex Strategy: Developing a more intricate strategy by adjusting parameters until a profitable strategy is found.
        Simple Moving Averages Strategy: Implementing a strategy based on the crossover of the simple moving averages (SMA) of the stock prices.

    Index Tracking:
        Identifying and creating a portfolio of 10 stocks to track the DJI index.
        Evaluating the performance of the tracking portfolio against the DJI index.
        Optimizing the tracking portfolio weights to minimize tracking error.
        Forward testing the optimized tracking portfolio to validate its performance in 2019.

    Comparison with Random Portfolios: Comparing the performance of the optimized tracking portfolio with 10,000 randomly generated portfolios to assess its effectiveness.

Overall, the project aims to demonstrate the process of data analysis, strategy backtesting, and portfolio optimization using real-world financial data and techniques.
