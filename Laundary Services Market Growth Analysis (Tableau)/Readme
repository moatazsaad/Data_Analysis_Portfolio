Overview:
WeWashYouSleep is a small laundry pick-up service startup facing significant competition from major players. 
In response, the company has devised a strategic plan to establish a robust network within smaller cities. Already boasting a strong presence in 140 locations, WeWashYouSleep recently expanded its operations by launching services in an additional 190 cities. Additionally, the company operates within two distinct sales regions.

Objective: 
- Determine which sales region outperforms the other across two of three key metrics:
    Average revenue per city
    Average marketing spend per city
    Average return on marketing investment (ROMI) per city (calculated as revenue divided by marketing spend)
- Identify the top ten new locations offering the greatest potential for the company to allocate additional funds towards marketing initiatives.

Approach and Findings:

Addressing Sales Region Analysis:
- Utilized visualizations for average revenue, marketing spend, and ROMI per city in each region.
- Identified Region 1 with higher average revenue, lower marketing spend, and higher ROMI.

Combining Population and Expansion Data:
- Integrated population data with expansion datasets for comprehensive analysis.
- Employed clustering techniques based on revenue, marketing spend, and population.

Cluster Analysis:
- Red cluster with low population and revenue.
- Orange cluster showing revenue increase with population.
- Blue cluster indicating even higher revenue with dense populations.

Trend Line Analysis:
Cluster 1: Loss observed for every dollar spent on marketing.
Cluster 2: Substantial revenue increase per marketing dollar.
Cluster 3: Highest return on investment, indicating optimal marketing allocation.

Based on these insights, prioritizing marketing investment in  stores within Cluster 3 emerges as the most effective strategy due to its high return on investment.
