This project explores the S&P 500 stock market data using Python libraries for data manipulation, visualization, and analysis. Here's an overview of the key aspects covered in the analysis:

- Data Import and Setup:
    The code starts by importing necessary libraries and mounting Google Drive to access data files. It navigates to the directory containing the data files.

- Combining Data:
    Multiple CSV files containing stock data for different companies are merged into a single DataFrame named all_data.

- Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA):
    Basic information about the combined dataset is provided, including data types and missing values.
    The change in stock prices over time for each company is visualized to understand the stock performance.

- Moving Average Analysis:
    Moving averages (10-day, 20-day, and 50-day) of stock closing prices are calculated and plotted to identify trends.

- Analyzing Specific Stocks:
    The closing price change for Apple stock is analyzed, and daily percentage returns are visualized over time.

- Resample Analysis:
    The closing prices are resampled by month, year, and quarter to analyze average prices over different time intervals.

- Correlation Analysis:
    Correlation between closing prices of tech companies (Apple, Amazon, Google, Microsoft) is explored using pair plots and a correlation heatmap.
    Additionally, correlation between daily percentage change in closing prices is examined to understand if there's a relationship between daily returns of different stocks.

This analysis provides insights into stock performance, trends, and relationships between different tech companies' stock prices, facilitating informed investment decisions.
