This project focuses on understanding the representation of different regions among our bank's customers.
Our objective is to analyze customer demographics and preferences across various regions.
The goal is to identify customer interests in different regions and improve our services accordingly.
To achieve this, I created a Tableau dashboard with a clear storyline.
The dashboard visually presents customer profiles, behaviors, and preferences from different regions.
