The Housing data analysis project aimed to explore factors influencing house prices in California and develop a predictive model using Random Forest Regression.

    Data Import and Exploration:
    The project started with importing the dataset and exploring its features, including geographical coordinates, housing characteristics, population, income, and median house values. Exploration involved checking for missing values, duplicates, and basic statistics.

    Data Cleaning and Feature Engineering:
    Data cleaning steps included handling missing values and creating new features such as rooms per household, population per household, and bedrooms per room. Categorical variables were encoded using one-hot encoding, and numerical columns were scaled using RobustScaler.

    Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA):
    EDA involved visualizing the distribution of key variables, exploring correlations between features and the target variable (median house value), and investigating geographical patterns using scatter plots and heatmaps. Factors influencing house prices, such as median income and ocean proximity, were analyzed.

    Random Forest Model Building:
    A Random Forest Regression model was built to predict median house prices. The dataset was split into training and testing sets, and the Random Forest model was trained using 500 estimators. Predictions were made on the test set.

    Model Evaluation:
    The performance of the Random Forest model was evaluated using metrics such as Mean Squared Error (MSE), Root Mean Squared Error (RMSE), and R-squared (R^2) score. The model demonstrated decent predictive performance, as indicated by the evaluation metrics.

    Feature Importance Analysis:
    The importance of features in predicting house prices was analyzed using the feature_importances_ attribute of the trained Random Forest model. Median income emerged as the most important feature, indicating its strong influence on median house values. Other important features included geographical coordinates, population per household, and bedrooms per room.

Overall, the project provided valuable insights into the factors driving house prices in California and demonstrated the effectiveness of Random Forest Regression for predicting median house values based on relevant features. The findings can be useful for real estate professionals, policymakers, and individuals interested in housing market trends.
